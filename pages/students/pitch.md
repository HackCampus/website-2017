## Learn the skills you can't get at university.

Being an effective programmer takes more than knowing the theoretical foundations. Doing an internship at a startup will help you gain real-world experience in team communication and project management that will set your CV apart from the rest - and unlike at huge tech companies or banks, you'll actually have a meaningful impact on your employer's products. In many cases, our interns have deployed production-ready code in their first week, sometimes even on their first day!

## Live with the smartest student hackers in Central London.

We provide you with a paid-for room in student accommodation in Central London, where you'll live with the other HackCampus interns working at startups over the summer. We've chosen the accommodation to be within short commuting distance to the participating companies' offices, and have made sure that you have a shared social space to get to know the other interns.

## Experience the London startup scene first-hand.

Apart from working with experienced engineers on your team, you'll also find that London boasts a huge number of meetups & events that cater to every possible interest. We will also organise exclusive events for the HackCampus cohort, where you'll get to meet some of the key players in the London startup scene.
