### 1. Interested students apply to us.

The HackCampus teams vets interns with an application questionnaire featuring technical and personal questions. This ranges from high-level technical design down to a mock code review. We ask students to submit examples of personal projects that they have worked on, and review the source code of their projects.

Additionally, students are asked to assign themselves a score on a wide range of programming languages, libraries and tools, collected from the tech stacks of the companies we work with. This allows us to closely match every intern's skillset with the requirements of your role.

### 2. We match students with startups.

We gather every company's requirements regarding technologies, skillset and diversity.

Based on the data we receive from students, and the specific requirements of each company, we make sure that you only speak to candidates that are suited for your role.

### 3. You perform technical screening.
