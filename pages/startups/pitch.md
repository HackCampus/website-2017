## Develop leadership skills in your tech team

Being an effective tech lead and mentor can only be learned with hands-on experience. Taking on interns is a highly effective and low-risk way to develop essential mentoring and leadership skills in your tech team.

Every tech team has projects that would be "nice to have", but don't have the resources to complete. Interns are a perfect choice for implementing prototypes of such projects, such as internal tools, or adding features to existing products.

## Raise your company's profile among the most talented students

Many of the students that have taken part in the programme are heavily involved in student societies, and participate in dozens of student hackathons across the country. Make sure your company gets mentioned when employers get discussed among students.
