### 1. Interested students apply to us.

The HackCampus teams vets interns with an application questionnaire featuring technical and personal questions. This ranges from high-level technical design down to a code review. We ask students to submit examples of personal projects that they have worked on, and review the source code of their projects.

Additionally, students are asked to assign themselves a score on a wide range of programming languages, libraries, databases & tools, collected from the tech stacks of the companies we work with. This allows us to closely match every intern's skillset with the requirements of your role.
